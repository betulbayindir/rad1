public class RadException extends Exception {
/**
 * This is a very basic custom exception class which extends the standard Salesforce Exceptions
 * It allows us to throw exceptions based on our own rules.  There is much more that we can do with a custom exception
 * (Send an email notification, save a record of the exception etc.)
 * For more information: https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_exception_custom.htm?search_text=custom%20exception
